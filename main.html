		<p>The historical monuments of Odisha stand testament to the glorious architectural heritage of the state. The Kalinga Architecture as it is known came into existence in the 6th century AD and continued unabated till the 16th Century AD. The Kings or Gajapati’s of Kalinga irrespective of dynasty encouraged the architects to express their creativity by infusing life into stone. What makes the Kalinga Architecture so distinctive and pleasing to the eye is its, structural details, plan, elevation and skillfully crafted figurines which adorns the outer walls of the monuments.
